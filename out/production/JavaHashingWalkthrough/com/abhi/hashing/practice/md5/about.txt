The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a
128-bit (16-byte) hash value. It’s very simple and straight forward; the basic idea is to map data
sets of variable length to data sets of a fixed length.

 In order to do this, the input message is split into chunks of 512-bit blocks. A padding is added to
  the end so that it’s length can be divided by 512. Now, these blocks are processed by the MD5 algorithm,
  which operates in a 128-bit state, and the result will be a 128-bit hash value. After applying MD5,
  generated hash is typically a 32-digit hexadecimal number.

 Here, the password to be encoded is often called the “message” and the
 generated hash value is called the message digest or simply “digest”.
